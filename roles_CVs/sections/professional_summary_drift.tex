\section*{Motivation}

While my background includes senior roles and a wide range of technical responsibilities, I am genuinely interested in this position because it aligns closely with the kind of hands-on, operational work I find most meaningful. I enjoy working close to infrastructure, solving real problems, and contributing to secure, stable systems. 

At this point in my career, I am prioritizing roles where I can apply my experience in a practical and collaborative environment, without necessarily pursuing a management track. This position at Länsstyrelsen combines the right level of technical depth, public value, and team contribution – which is exactly what I’m looking for.
