% \section*{Operations and Deployment Expertise}

% I have several years of experience in operations, troubleshooting, and automated deployment in both Linux and Windows environments. I've worked as an IT Problem Manager and participated in real-time incident handling. I build and maintain systems with a focus on reliability, security, and automation.

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item CI/CD pipelines: Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
%   \item Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, YAML, Helm
%   \item Scripting and automation: Bash, PowerShell
%   \item Containerization and orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes
%   \item Troubleshooting tools: \texttt{curl}, \texttt{tcpdump}, \texttt{htop}, \texttt{nmap}, and log tools like Splunk
%   \item Automated testing and deployment: CA Lisa, integration testing in complex environments
%   \item Real-time incident resolution with cross-functional teams
%   \item Cloud platforms: Azure (certified in Azure Fundamentals, currently preparing for AZ-500)
