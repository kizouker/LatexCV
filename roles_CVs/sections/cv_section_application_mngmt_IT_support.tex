\section{Support and Application Management Experience}

\cvitem{}{
With a strong foundation in IT operations, I have extensive experience in Application Management, Problem Management, and Service Desk collaboration. At Hi3G (TRE), I acted as Application Lead for 15 critical business systems including CRM and billing, working closely with 2nd-line support and operations to ensure availability and stability.

As Problem Manager at LÃ¤nsstyrelsen IT, I coordinated cross-functional teams to conduct root cause analysis, optimize support processes, and implement architectural improvements that reduced recurring errors by over 90\%. I maintained daily contact with Service Desk coordinators and domain experts across areas such as networks, GIS, hardware, and Windows infrastructure.

At Ikano Bank, I served as Release Manager and DevOps Coach, facilitating knowledge transfer, release flow automation, and coordination between development, operations, and support teams. I introduced structured deployment strategies and improved collaboration between Service Desk and backend teams.

These roles have strengthened my ability to bridge technical and user-facing domains, deliver structured problem-solving, and support users and systems with both precision and empathy.
