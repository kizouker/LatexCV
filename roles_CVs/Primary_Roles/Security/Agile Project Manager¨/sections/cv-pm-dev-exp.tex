\cvitem{}{Throughout my career, I have alternated between technical roles — such as developer, integration specialist, and software architect — and leadership roles — including project manager, Scrum Master, and DevOps lead. This dual path has enabled me to bridge communication between business and technology. Any apparent gaps in my employment history are the result of deliberate transitions between project-based engagements in these two domains.}
