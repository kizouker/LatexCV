Om jobbet
Do you want to make the world a safer place while being part of a team where experience and collaboration are truly valued?

Would you like to join a global and technically skilled team that plays an essential role in Verisure’s success?

Are you a backend-focused problem-solver who brings clarity and composure in fast-paced, high-ambition environments, with a strong belief in knowledge-sharing and steady teamwork?

Then this might be the right opportunity for you! ⬇

About the job

In this role, you will build and contribute to the Backend of our smart home alarm products for the future. You’ll be a vital part of an empowered agile team that develops critical internal systems and tools — essential software components that make everything tick in our product portfolio.

You will be joining a collaborative team of 17 skilled and fun colleagues who value deep collaboration, shared problem-solving, and long-term thinking, led by Patrik Klinger, an ambitious and energetic leader who places a strong emphasis on teamwork and tackling challenges collectively.

We truly enjoy coming into the office — not just for productivity, but because we believe trust, laughter, and fast learning happen faster face-to-face. In our team, being present and connected creates the glue that helps us thrive even when the pressure is high. We expect you to appreciate and contribute to this in-person collaboration culture.
 

About you

Most importantly, you are a team player who combines strong technical skills with empathy and humility. You share your knowledge generously and welcome the expertise of others.

You bring a senior mindset — calm, focus and clear thinking, even in complex or high-pressure situations. You’re structured, curious, and motivated to find the best solutions together with your team. You’re also comfortable working independently and navigating ambiguity when needed.

Also, great if you have:
     * Several years of hands-on experience in backend development

     * Experience in DevOps / Automation environments
     * Familiarity with agile methodologies such as Scrum or other iterative ways of working
     * Practical experience with as many of the following technologies and software development domains as possible: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, GIT, Kubernetes, Docker, RabbitMQ, Python, JavaScript, Typescript and React.

We don’t expect you to tick every box — what matters most is your mindset, approach, and the depth you bring in one or more relevant areas.

If large parts of the above sound exciting to you, and if you want to be part of a warm, driven and capable team that values both deep focus and good coffee — and you bring a senior calm to everything you do — we’d love to hear from you. Apply today!
