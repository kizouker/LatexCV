The container in which we allow ourselves to experience life often gets smaller and smaller, until we can’t move without bumping up against a wall”, (Steven Leonard, movement specialist).

I’m dedicated to the intersection between people, processes, psychology and the pursuit of finding the truth no matter how far I have to look.

For several years I promoted DevOps, in the CPH Area in the Bank Industry. After that I needed to get some perspective, and introspection. Curious, and with the mindset from Zen-buddhism, "Shoshin" (Beginner's mind) I'm now asking myself the question how can "Pedagogical Drama" ameliorate group dynamics?

Well, not totally - I couldn't keep my hands off the keyboard - I also delved into React JS.

What is beginner's mind?
By definition, having a beginner’s mind means having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and freedom from preconceptions when approaching anything. Beginner’s mind is actually the space where the mind does not know what to do. It is that delicious state when you are sure of nothing, yet completely fearless, totally available to the moment.
